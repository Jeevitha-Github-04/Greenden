Greenden is a simple and responsive plant store website built using HTML and Tailwind CSS.
The project includes three main pages — Home, Products, and Contact — each designed to provide a smooth and visually appealing browsing experience for plant lovers.

The website showcases a clean modern UI with a natural theme, featuring a product gallery, navigation bar, contact form, and responsive layout optimized for all screen sizes. This project demonstrates the use of Tailwind utility classes to build a fast, lightweight, and well-structured frontend without any JavaScript framework.
